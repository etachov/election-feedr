# election-feedr

This script (1) pulls elections from <a href = "http://www.electionguide.org/" target = "_blank"> IFES' Election Guide Calendar</a>, (2) filters the elections against a vector of countries supplied by the user to produce a final list of upcoming elections in countries of interest.

I use this script to keep tabs on elections in countries where <a href = "http://www.mdif.org" target = "_blank">MDIF</a> has investments. When an election takes place, we like to evaluate how our client's coverage compares with other media sources in the country. We visualize the results in our <a href = "http://www.mdif.org/client-election-coverage/">Election StoryMap</a>.
